# D's Maptool Character Sheet for Pathfinder

## A mostly finished interactive character sheet designed to work on any token

### Features
  * Uses modular functions to work with any Pog with minor prior setup
  * Prompts the user for input if data is missing
  * Automatically detects if variables are not initialized and initializes them - this is a live environment so this is not normal for this 'language'
  * Employs clever workarounds for the nesting limits such as building strings using multiple 'macros' (basically functions)
  * Uses HTML and CSS to clearly and neatly display information
  * Customizeable 'attacks' that allow automation of the pathfinder combat system
  * Self-learning Resistances and Immunities - asks player for input if it does not know, but keeps record of all player inputs for future reference
  * Prompts to edit or customize any data on the sheet
  * Created for usability - knowing I could not predict everything in the Pathfinder game, I made sure players can add bonuses and detriments on the fly
  * Very modular - created in such a way that it can apply to any token or pog without prior setup, making a GameMaster's job much easier for creating enemies since they do not need their own macros
  
  
  
These may not be all of the project files; some of the smaller macros I did not save to text.  The campaign file should contain the Test:Lib pog with all relevant functions for those who are interested, to be opened in MapTool itself
