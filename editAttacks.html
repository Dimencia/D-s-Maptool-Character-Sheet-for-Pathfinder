<!-- The idea is that we can initialize all the vars 
up here, and pull them from args.  The form should call
this function again until it's complete
Not sure what 'complete' means yet tho.  I guess when
the last entry isn't default.  

Actually tho.  First, we ask NumAttacks, attackName, Cost
Then a next button to another whole 'sheet' where 
we prepare a table of each attack and its bonus and damage
That sheet then does the submission and saving.
This table should include separate range for each attack
Since any attack may be with multiple weapons

We can store those attacks as something like
_flurryKi_Attack2Damage etc and reference them later

With either, any variable can be set up by putting the
getProperty() inside the field


<tr><th>Cost:</th><td><input name="costValue" value=""></input> of this Variable: <input name="costVariable" value=""></input></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Enter the name of the pool to subtract from
<br>For example, entering "1" and "Ki" would work
<br>You can always leave the cost blank
<br>We'll fine-tune the details in the next step.
</td></tr>
