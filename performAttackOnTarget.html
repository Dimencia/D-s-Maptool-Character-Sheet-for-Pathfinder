<!-- 
Right, so, newest ideas: 
Instead of displaying to chat, open up a dialog window to show
the player the results as they come in.  At any point, 
give them an 'edit' button, and a 'submit' button if 
they are satisfied.  
They cannot edit die rolls, but have buttons to force 20
or reroll and subtract the penalties

This dialog window would take as input an arraymap
first AttackName, then attacks remaining
Then _(attackNumber)varName formatting
We then don't have to store this stuff on the pog
So naming isn't that important
Each edit we change the value and pass it back to the dialog
Remember we have to recalc any relevant values, so do that
at the start why not

Make sure you can't close this window without submitting

We'll use AttackNumber to detect if it's a fresh window
And we copy over the args to a _original arraylist
And put these as hidden inputs

Always, we store the original 
values in their own varlist. We also include a notes
section for player to explain what happened
This dialog will show the projected HP bar of the attacked 
targets but won't apply damage yet.
Make 'DR Applies' a checkbox.
I guess make this an editable form by default
But warn the player that all changes are documented
When this is submitted, pop up to GM and ask for approval
Show any player edits as a tooltip if the original var
doesn't match the submitted var, and red
Also allow the GM to edit any of these values, including
things like Total Damage to stealthily fudge things
On this approval sheet ask GM for flavor text or give the option
to have player write flavor.  If accepted and player write, 
obviously pop up to the player and prompt for flavor
Only after the flavor is submitted, show the attacks and damage
nicely in a table in chat, with minimal info
Mostly just show the dice and total bonus for each damage
and attack
Then the flavor immediately
In either case, apply damage and death states



BTW next thing to do is add the attack type to the attack
since that kinda overhauls the system and will be required
We will also need crit mult, crit chance, 
crit attack confirm bonus, crit damage bonus
And to start, just one extra elemental damage bonus and type
I'd like it to generate more fields for more damage bonuses
and types if you fill them.  Could make an update button
that just calls a macro that 
 increments _attackName_numDamageTypes which would
make it create more damage type fields 
We would store these as a list in _attackName_attack2_damageType
 -->
<!-- Not do it here obviously, just in general, then get
back to finishing this -->
<!-- Anyway, remember that once we make this attack we open
a new macro to update the combat window, not the usual macro
Unless remaining attacks is 0 after this in which case the 
normal combat window again and erase InProgressAttackName
We also need a skip button to skip an attack, and to
display attack bonus, and/or hit% chance for each attack
in general on the combat screen

For now let's pretend I don't have the DR bypass thing, 
we can fix that later probably since it's pretty custom
As for Resistances, not worth dealing with yet, maybe eventually/
But we will need a DR field for each attack, comma separated

Idea for resistances, ask the player if it applies
and store it in a list on the library.  Name it something like
_doesNotResistList and _resistsList
Where each is a key-value pair, with the key being the attacks
'DR' or damage type value, and the pair being a list of 
'Resistances' values that are known to resist or not resist
And you pass this list the full resistances string
So if you encounter it again it already knows
that damagetype 'Cold Iron, Adamantine, Magic' does not 
get resistance applied for resist type 'elemental(10)'

Another random idea, if you kill a unit, prompt the player
to enter flavor text

Also totally random idea, make an OOC chat tab for lulz?
By which I mean, make two tabs, and we treat one
as a regular chat tab but it doesn't show anything
that's fully enclosed in ()
and the OOC tab shows those things, but still just one 
input.  
I wonder if you can overwrite the original chat window
if you can get the right frame name?
But logging might be a problem.  Need to ask jordan
how she saves logs to see if I can mimic the behavior
